    d = Directory
    f = File

-name


The syntax for how I search is:
$ find <path> -type <#> -name <fileName>

For example, if I wanted to search the entire system, I'd start at the root folder which is symbolized using "/"

$ find / -type f -name host*
> /etc/hostname
> /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/hosts_access
> /etc/ansible/hosts/hosts.yaml
> /etc/hosts.deny
> /etc/hosts
> /etc/host.conf
> /etc/hosts.allow

'*' is a wildcard and matches any string that contains the characters preceeding it.
If you come across an error like
> find: paths must precede expression:
Place the file/directory name you are searching in quotes.

Ex:
$ find /etc/ -name sud*
> find: paths must precede expression: `sudoers'
> find: possible unquoted pattern after predicate `-name'?
$ find /etc/ -name "sud*"
> /etc/init.d/sudo
> /etc/sudo.conf
> /etc/pam.d/sudo-i
> /etc/pam.d/sudo
> /etc/sudoers
> /etc/sudo_logsrvd.conf
> /etc/sudoers.d
