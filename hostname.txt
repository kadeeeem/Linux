#--- Change hostname of a Linux device
# Find out where the "hostname" file is located
# It's typically located under /etc/hostname
# Confirm using the command below
find /etc/ -type f -name hostname*
# /etc/ indicates the directory to initiate the search. You can search the entire computer using "/"
# -type indicates the file type. "hostname" is a file, so we use "f" which indicates a file

# Navigate to the file path retrieved from your search. In my case its:
cd /etc/
# Edit the hostname file
sudo nano hostname
# Change to your desired name
