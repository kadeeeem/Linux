# Linux
Welcome to my Linux repository.  
Here, I have created a library of documentation that I have found to useful through my journey of study.  
The information ranges from tasks as basic as renaming directories, to Samba config files.  
I'm also building a library of other topics that I'm training, Ansible, Python, etc. Check them out if that's your thing.  
  
Hope you find this useful. *Thumbs up*
