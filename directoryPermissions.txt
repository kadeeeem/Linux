#--- Read directory permissions
ls -l -d <directory>

# -l lists all details about a directory
# -d will target directories
# -l -d can be abbreviated to -ld <directory>

#--- Permission types
# r = read
# w = write
# x = execute
# Permissions are applied in sets
# -[owner][group][others]
# -rwxr-xr--
# In the above, the owner can read, write, and execute.(rwx)
# The user group can read and execute(r-x)
# Users who do not fall into the "owner" category and are not assigned to associated group can read only (r--)

#--- Setting permissions
# Permissions can be changed individually for specific users, groups, or others
# u specifies users.=
# g specifies groups
# o specifies others
# ugo or a(all) applies permission changes to all
# Not entirely sure but I think the user and groups are associated to the directory using a different method. The ugo just applies the permissions to people associated
# Syntax examples
chmod g+w <directory> --> Applies write permissions to the group
chmod ugo+rwx <directory> --> Applies read, write, and execute permissions to everyone

#--- Set permissions for all subfolders
sudo chmod -R 777 /parent/subfolder
# -R parameter targets all subfolders
# 777 Grants rwx permissions
